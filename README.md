## GETTING STARTED

### If you are new to Pandas or Python

1. Set up Jupyter notebooks (see below)
2. Work through the examples step by step.

New to Pandas
1. Make sure you learn Python and SQL basics before Pandas (my recommendation)
2. This pandas intro course is useful - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcDaZ67TVRo&t=7270s
